# Welcome to Annosz's Stardew Valley modding guide

Stardew Valley is a fantastic game. The tranquil, simple - yet in the same time, extremely deep - contryside absorbed me at the moment I set foot in Pelican Town. The farming help me in my final years of university when *"I'd lost sight of what mattered most in the life..."* and after the multiplayer update, I even managed to find new friends in the game.

As a programmer and serial modder, after a few playthrough I naturally started to search for mods, to deepen this experience even more. I joyfully discovered that the modding community for this game is exremel active, the tools are consistently kept up-to-date with the latest patches and even inexperienced modders are encouraged to start their own projects and enrich the game.

This guide is ment to be a help for those, who are not really technically savy or does not have the time to browse wiki sites, forums or Discord to find and compare the available mods, but want to use them and have as much fun with Stardew Valley as possible - just like me.
