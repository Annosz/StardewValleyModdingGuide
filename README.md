# Welcome to Annosz's Stardew Valley modding guide

Stardew Valley is a fantastic game. The tranquil, simple - yet in the same time, extremely deep - contryside absorbed me at the moment I set foot in Pelican Town. The farming help me in my final years of university when *"I'd lost sight of what mattered most in the life..."* and after the multiplayer update, I even managed to find new friends in the game.

As a programmer and serial modder, after a few playthrough I naturally started to search for mods, to deepen this experience even more. I joyfully discovered that the modding community for this game is exremel active, the tools are consistently kept up-to-date with the latest patches and even inexperienced modders are encouraged to start their own projects and enrich the game.

This guide is ment to be a help for those, who are not really technically savy or does not have the time to browse wiki sites, forums or Discord to find and compare the available mods, but want to use them and have as much fun with Stardew Valley as possible - just like me.

## How to use this guide

This guide's greatest advantage is that it's written by me.

Also, this guide's greatest weaknes is that its written by *me*.

This means, that this guide - even if it tries to be a comprehensive, objective guide - will contain some of my opinion about the mods mentioned. I will feature very few mod as mandatory (mainly in the *Before you start modding* section, which are really **mandatory**), so you don't have to worry that I will change your game experience in a way you don't want to. However, I will tag a lot of mods as **not recommended**, because they are simply unbalanced or ruin the immersion (for me). When I say you should not install a mod, I will always mark my reason too, and you are free to second-guess it.

A few other things you should keep in mind while you read this guide:
- I mainly wrote this guide with the intention to help my friends, who play the game but are not *expert* modders. This means I try to give exact instructions on how to install the mods, how to use the tools and how to check for errors. If you are more experienced, maybe you will read a lot of boring information (mainly because Stardew Valley is generally easy to mod).
- This mod list is **not complete**. You will always found other mods on the internet, and you are free to go and look for anything that satisfies your special interest. I tipically do not feature mods, that are targeted for a very small audience(?), such as the mod that [lets you ride Chocobos](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2613 "Chokobomod") from Final Fantasy, or the one that replaces every marriable male character to [girls with huge breasts](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/474 "StardewValley_Girl-byAdarin"). You have to search for theese yourself.
- No guide can always be completely up-to-date. To help this, I will talk a lot in the section *Finishing up* about typical errors, messages and their solutions, hoping, that when the game updates or the mods change version you will still be able to fix the majority of problems alone.
- At many places you will be presented with a collection of mods which are not compatible with each other. In these cases, you will have to make a decision which one yo want to install - it only depends on your taste.

## Resources

# Before you start modding

To install mods, you first need to make some preparations. In the whole guide these will be the only steps, that are mandatory (or at least SMAPI and Content Patcher), and you have to make these **before installing any other mods**.

### SMAPI
**SMAPI (Stardew Modding API)** is the main foundation we have to build on. This is the API (Application Programming Interface) that let's modders to change the game, and write extensions to it - which means basically *every* mod needs it. It also provides update checks and compatibility checks between mods: you will see warnings when you start the game which let you know that you have to download the latest version of a mod. It also provides error check, so a misfuncioning mod won't crash your whole game or corrupt you save if you load it with SMAPI - so yeah, it is pretty important.

There are a lot of places where you can download SMAPI, but I suggest [smapi.io](https://smapi.io/), where you will always find the latest version. I don't want to give detailed information about installing it (although this will probaby be the hardest thing to install in the guide), because there are a lot of resources for it: I suggest to follow the SMAPI install guide on Stardew Valley Wiki, which has instructions fow [Windows](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing_SMAPI_on_Windows "Modding:Installing SMAPI on Windows") (there is even an [unofficial video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ULXeC9CL0c "How to Install SMAPI + Mods for Stardew Valley (PC)") from MollyPop
), [Mac](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing_SMAPI_on_Mac "Modding:Installing SMAPI on Mac") and [Linux](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Installing_SMAPI_on_Linux "Modding:Installing SMAPI on Linux") too.

It is important to install SMAPI correctly: if you use the Steam version of the game, modify the launch options like written in the guide, otherwise you will not be able to earn achievements.

### ~~StarDew Valley ModManager~~
**StarDew Valley Mod Manager (SDVMM)** was a very useful tool when it was regularly updated. I mainly feature it here to warn everyone that today it throws errors for almost anything, so it's not worth downloading. It's main features (updating SMAPI, mods, enabling and disabling them, launching the game) can be all done with other (or without) tools.

The ModManager was originally available on the [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21?tab=posts "StarDev Valley ModManager"), where an installation guide video is available, and you could download the latest version from the [Github page] (https://github.com/yuukiw/StardewValleyMM/releases "StarDev Valley ModManager"), but again, I don't recommend it.

### Content Patcher

In the *How to install the mods* section I'm going to talk more about the two types of mods. What you need to know is that in the old times, to install mods, you had to edit game files - for every mod, there was a different file in a different location, with the risk of corrupting your whole game. This is what changed with **Content Patcher**: it makes it possible to install Mods by simply copying them to a folder, checking for updates or removing them without editing the game files.

You have to install [Content Packer](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/1915) **after SMAPI**, similary to installing any mods: extracting it to the mods folder (discussed in the *How to install the mods* section).

## How to install the mods

## 1. Graphic mods
- [Eemie's Seasonal Victorian Buildings - Content Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3691): New Vistorian buildings, if you are into this stuff (you are playing Stardew Valley, so I guess you must be into beautiful stuff). Use this Content Patcher version instead of any old one you find.
- [Obelisk Overhaul Inspired By Eemi Seasonal Victorian](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3198): Replaces the obelisks to match the previously installed victorian mod.
- [SMAPI Seasonal Victoraian Buildings and Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2050): A very nice recolor, that does well with the *Seasonal Victoraian Buildings and Flowers*. Use this Content Patcher version instead of any old one you find. After you start the game once and the config files are generated, you can edit the options for recolor, as written in the mod description.
